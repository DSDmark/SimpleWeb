### How to install 😒

You can utilise that software in two different ways.

- Using **Nodejs**. 
- Using **Docker**. 

#### Frist, here is by using **Nodejs**.

1. Click on green **Clone or download** button and choose Download ZIP.
2. Find the downloaded zipped file on your pc and **extract it**.
3. Then install `nodejs` and `NPM` in your local system.
4. Open the Root Directory, navigate to SimpleCURD using the command `cd SimpleCURD` and use either `npm install` or `pnpm install` to install all dependencies in the frontend and backend directories.
It used `concurrently:7.6.0` in this project. So, you may use the `npm start` command in root folder, once you have finished installing all dependencies in each folder that contains a `package.json` file. 

#### Second, here is by using **Docker**.

1. Click on green **Clone or download** button and choose Download ZIP.
2. Find the downloaded zipped file on your pc and **extract it**.
3. Then install `Docker` in your local system.
4. Run that command simply.
`docker-compose up -d`.
5. You can now open the **frontend** at `localhost:3000` and the **backend** at `localhost:4000` in your browser.

Once you are done you can close 🔒 the application in your terminal to quit the application.
